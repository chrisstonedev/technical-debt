# Technical Debt

This project was created to demonstrate different types of technical debt and how to mitigate them as a part of my technical talk, "Buried in Technical Debt? Making the Right Investments in Your Code".

I have a recording of this talk, a list of events where I have given this talk, and the accompanying slides on my website: https://chrisstone.dev/speaking/technical-debt

## Testing

In addition to the OrderCore.ServerTests unit test project located in this repository, UI tests can be found in the **[chrisstonedev/ui-test-runner](https://github.com/chrisstonedev/ui-test-runner)** project. This project used to be a part of this repository. Soon, this separate repository will handle the project that runs the tests while the specific tests for this project will be reintroduced to this repository.

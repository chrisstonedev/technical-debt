# Technical Debt

This project was created to demonstrate different types of technical debt and how to mitigate them as a part of my technical talk, "Buried in Technical Debt? Making the Right Investments in Your Code".

I have a recording of this talk, a list of events where I have given this talk, and the accompanying slides on my website: https://chrisstone.dev/speaking/technical-debt
